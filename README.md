# Triage Party ðŸŽ‰

`NOTE: This is not an officially supported Google product`

Triage Party is a tool for triaging incoming GitHub issues for large open-source projects, built with the GitHub API.

Triage Party focuses on reducing response latency for incoming GitHub issues and PR's, and ensure that conversations are not lost in the ether. It was built from the [Google Container DevEx team](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools)'s experience contributing to popular open-source projects, such as [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/), and [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/).

Triage Party is a stateless Go web application, configured via YAML. While it has been optimized for Google Cloud Run deployments, it's deployable anywhere due to its low memory footprint: even on a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

* Queries that are not possible on GitHub:
  * conversation state (`tag: recv`, `tag: send`)
  * how long since a project member responded (`responded: +15d`)
  * duration (`updated: +30d`)
  * regexp (`label: priority/.*`)
  * reactions (`reactions: >=5`)
  * comment popularity (`comments-per-month: >0.9`)
  * duplicate detection
  * ... and more!
* Multi-player mode: Supports up to 20 simultaneous players in group triage
* Easily open groups of issues into browser tabs (must allow pop-ups)
* Queries across multiple repositories
* "Shift-Reload" for live data pull

## Triage Party in production

See these fine examples in the wild:

* [kubernetes/minikube](http://tinyurl.com/mk-tparty)
* [GoogleContainerTools/skaffold](http://tinyurl.com/skaffold-tparty)
* [jetstack/cert-manager](https://triage.build-infra.jetstack.net/)

## Requirements

* [GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
* Go v1.14 or higher

## Try it locally

See what Triage Party would look like for an arbitrary repository:

```shell
go run cmd/server/main.go \
  --github-token-file=<path to a file containing your github token> \
  --config examples/generic-kubernetes.yaml \
  --repos kubernetes/sig-release
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

The first time you run Triage Party against a new repository, there will be a long delay as it will download data from GitHub. This data will be cached for subsequent runs. We're working to improve this latency.

## Configuration

### Creating a Github token file

1. Create a GitHub token: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
2. Store token by pasting it into a text-file:
`echo YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN > /path/to/file`

### Configuring collections and rules

Each page within Triage Party is represented by a `collection`. Each collection references a list of `rules` that can be shared across collections. Here is a simple collection, which creates a page named `I like soup!`, containing two rules:

```yaml
collections:
  - id: soup
    name: I like soup!
    rules:
      - discuss
      - many-reactions
```

The first rule, `discuss`, include all items labelled as `triage/discuss`, whether they are pull requests or issues, open or closed.


```yaml
rules:
  discuss:
    name: "Items for discussion"
    resolution: "Discuss and remove label"
    filters:
      - label: triage/discuss
      - state: "all"
```

The second rule, `many-reactions`, is more fine-grained. It is only focused on issues that have seen more than 3 comments, with an average of over 1 reaction per month, is not prioritized highly, and has not seen a response by a member of the project within 2 months:

``` yaml
  many-reactions:
    name: "many reactions, low priority, no recent comment"
    resolution: "Bump the priority, add a comment"
    type: issue
    filters:
      - reactions: ">3"
      - reactions-per-month: ">1"
      - label: "!priority/p0"
      - label: "!priority/p1"
      - responded: +60d
```

For full example configurations, see `examples/*.yaml`. There are two that are particularly useful to get started:

* [generic-project](examples/generic-project.yaml): uses label regular expressions that work for most GitHub projects
* [generic-kubernetes](examples/generic-project.yaml): for projects that use Kubernetes-style labels, particularly  prioritization

## Filter language

```yaml
# issue state (default is "open")
- state:(open|closed|all)

# GitHub label
- label: [!]regex

# Issue or PR title
- title: [!]regex

# Internal tagging: particularly useful tags are:
# - recv: updated by author more recently than a project member
# - recv-q: updated by author with a question
# - send: updated by a project member more recently than the author
- tag: [!]regex

# GitHub milestone
- milestone: string

# Duration since item was created
- created: [-+]duration   # example: +30d
# Duration since item was updated
- updated: [-+]duration
# Duration since item was responded to by a project member
- responded: [-+]duration

# Number of reactions this item has received
- reactions: [><=]int  # example: +5
# Number of reactions per month on average
- reactions-per-month: [><=]float

# Number of comments this item has received
- comments: [><=]int
# Number of comments per month on average
- comments-per-month: [><=]int
# Number of comments this item has received while closed!
- comments-while-closed: [><=]int

# Number of commenters on this item
- commenters: [><=]int
# Number of commenters who have interactive with this item while closed
- commenters-while-closed: [><=]int
# Number of commenters tthis item has had per month on average
- commenters-per-month: [><=]float
```

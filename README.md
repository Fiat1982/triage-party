# Triage Party ðŸŽ‰

`NOTE: This is not an officially supported Google product`

Triage Party is a tool for triaging incoming GitHub issues for large open-source projects, built with the GitHub API.

Triage focuses on reducing response latency for incoming GitHub issues and PR's, and ensure that conversations are not lost in the ether. It was built from the [Google Container DevEx team](http://github.com/GoogleContainerTools)'s experience contributing to open-source projects, such as minikube, kaniko, and skaffold.

Triage Party is a stateless Go web application, configured via YAML. While it has been optimized for Google Cloud Run deployments, it's deployable anywhere due to its low memory footprint: even on a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

* Queries across multiple repositories
* Queries that are not possible on GitHub:
  * conversation direction (`tag: recv`)
  * duration (`updated: +30d`)
  * regexp (`label: priority/.*`)
  * reactions (`reactions: >=5`)
  * comment popularity (`comments-per-month: >0.9`)
  * ... and more!
* Multi-player mode: for simultaneous group triage of a pool of issues
* Button to open issue groups as browser tabs (pop-ups must be disabled)
* "Shift-Reload" for live data pull

## Requirements

* [GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
* Go v1.14 or higher

## Triage Party in production

Triage Party is used in production for [kubernetes/minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube):

* [Triage Party dashboard](http://tinyurl.com/mk-tparty)
* [configuration file](examples/minikube.yaml)
* [Cloud Run deployment script](examples/minikube-deploy.sh)

Other examples:

* [GoogleContainerTools/skaffold Triage Party](https://skaffold-triage-party-eyodkz2nea-uc.a.run.app/)

## Try it locally

See what Triage Party would look like for an arbitrary repository:

```shell
go run cmd/server/main.go \
  --github-token-file=<path to a github token> \
  --config examples/generic-kubernetes.yaml \
  --repos kubernetes/sig-release
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

The first time you run Triage Party against a new repository, there will be a long delay as it will download data from GitHub. This data will be cached for subsequent runs. We're working to improve this latency.

## Configuration

Each page is configured with a `strategy` that references multiple queries (`tactics`). These tactics can be shared across pages:

```yaml
strategies:
  - id: soup
    name: I like soup!
    tactics:
      - discuss
      - many-reactions

tactics:
  discuss:
    name: "Items for discussion"
    resolution: "Discuss and remove label"
    filters:
      - label: triage/discuss
      - state: "all"

  many-reactions:
    name: "many reactions, low priority, no recent comment"
    resolution: "Bump the priority, add a comment"
    filters:
      - reactions: ">3"
      - reactions-per-month: ">1"
      - label: "!priority/p0"
      - label: "!priority/p1"
      - responded: +60d
```

For example configurations, see `examples/*.yaml`. There are two that are particularly useful to get started:

* [generic-project](examples/generic-project.yaml): uses label regular expressions that work for most GitHub projects
* [generic-kubernetes](examples/generic-project.yaml): for projects that use Kubernetes-style labels, particularly  prioritization

## Filter language

```yaml
# issue state (default is "open")
- state:(open|closed|all)

# GitHub label
- label: [!]regex

# Internal tagging: particularly useful tags are:
# - recv: updated by author more recently than a project member
# - recv-q: updated by author with a question
# - send: updated by a project member more recently than the author
- tag: [!]regex

# GitHub milestone
- milestone: string

# Duration since item was created
- created: [-+]duration   # example: +30d
# Duration since item was updated
- updated: [-+]duration
# Duration since item was responded to by a project member
- responded: [-+]duration

# Number of reactions this item has received
- reactions: [><=]int  # example: +5
# Number of reactions per month on average
- reactions-per-month: [><=]float

# Number of comments this item has received
- comments: [><=]int
# Number of comments per month on average
- comments-per-month: [><=]int
# Number of comments this item has received while closed!
- comments-while-closed: [><=]int

# Number of commenters on this item
- commenters: [><=]int
# Number of commenters who have interactive with this item while closed
- commenters-while-closed: [><=]int
# Number of commenters tthis item has had per month on average
- commenters-per-month: [><=]float
```
